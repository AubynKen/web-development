### Intermediate CSS Notes

setting font size:

**font-size** : px/em/rem:

**px** : pixels, it's a static font size.

**em**: pronunced as "M", historically the width of a M character. **em** is dynamic as opposed to **px** which is static, so when you set the font to large this gets big as well. When you set the font size unit to em, it gets added up with the font size of the parent.

**rem** : root em, ***does not inherit*** from parent class. The safest one to use.
