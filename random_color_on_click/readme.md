# What is this folder?
This is a micro-exercise for practicing dom manipulation and the "this" keyword in javascript.

The goal of this exercise is to create a bunch of html elements (here I used a bunch of h1 elements, but the choice was totally random), and when a user clicks on one of the elements, that element changes its text color and its background color to random colors.
